# Six Big Ideas in Machine Learning

**Note: We suggest you timebox this section to a maximum of 60 minutes
to start, including the exercise. Beware of the many interesting rabbit
holes that could consume your day. You can always revisit this later.**

Before diving into the specifics of our first machine learning
algorithm, let's examine some important ideas in machine learning.

## Idea 1: Correlations for the Win?

ML algorithms learn to exploit correlations in data in order to make
predictions. For instance, if one was using an ML algorithm to recognize
whether someone was smiling in an image, the algorithm might learn that
bright pixels around the mouth region are correlated with smiles (e.g.,
these bright pixels could indicate that a person's teeth are showing). This correlation would
likely be useful for determining whether a new image of a face was of a smiling person (or not).
Now suppose you take this model and apply it to a new
dataset. You may find that faces that are angry are mistakenly marked as
smiling! Why? In the case of angry facial expressions the teeth may also
be showing. Of course you would expect the learning algorithm to be
smart enough to realize that just using the presence of teeth is not
enough to conclusively determine whether someone is smiling. Whether or
not this actually happens is a function of the training data given to
the ML algorithm. If, for instance, the training set was scraped from
profile pictures from a dating website, the training set may not contain
pictures of angry faces. Unfortunately, while exploiting correlations is
one of the most powerful aspects of ML systems, it is also one of the
most potentially problematic.

*Example 1: Reinforcing Hiring Biases* You may have heard that [Amazon
scrapped a secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against
women](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G).
More specifically, the tool performed automatic keyword analysis of job
applications to predict whether or not the applicant was worth
forwarding on to a human for further evaluation. Early in the
development of this system researchers discovered that the model the
system had learned placed a negative weight on words such as "women's"
as well as the names of some women's colleges. While there is of course
no causal link between these words appearing in a job application and
the suitability of the candidate for the job, there was a *correlation*
in the training set between the presence of words such as "women's" and
the candidates not being invited for interviews.

Why might such a correlation exist in the training set? There are many
different possible explanations for this correlation, ranging from overt
or unconscious bias in the applicant evaluators whose judgments helped
form the training data to systemic discrimination that denies women
equal access to educational opportunities in STEM. The important thing
to take away from this is not *why* there was a correlation, but that
the existence of the correlation in the training data caused the model
to utilize the correlation in order to evaluate new data. Amazon
realized that this was very bad and decided to take steps to address the
problem (they say they never used the system to make actual
job-screening decisions). Despite efforts to prevent the algorithm for
exploiting such correlations, the group determined that they couldn't
fully guarantee that the algorithm had not found another way to achieve
the same discriminatory outcome and terminated the project.

A more modern example of the Amazon AI recruiting tool the task of detecting and [mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs)](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/understanding-and-mitigating-bias-in-large-language-models-llms).  Researchers are hard at work creating additional methods to mitigate and detect biases in these models (you might consider skimming the linked article for a high-level picture of what this looks like in practice.)

*Example 2: Adversarial Machine Learning*

A second example of an ML algorithm exploiting correlations in training
data in unexpected ways can be found in computer vision methods for
object detection. Identifying salient visual objects such as road signs
and pedestrians is an important building block for applications such as
autonomous cars. A popular algorithm for this task,
[YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) (You Only Look Once)[^1], can
identify and localize objects in images with surprising accuracy. For
instance, in the image below YOLO identified the stop sign in the image
successfully.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="figures/stopsignyolo.jpeg" width="50%"/>
</div>

While this all seems great, there is a catch. It is very difficult to
understand *how* YOLO is making these predictions. That is, what is it
about this image that causes the YOLO algorithm to be able to tell that
it is a stop sign? Perhaps it is the white text on the red background.
Perhaps it is the word "STOP." In fact, the network that makes this
prediction is so complex, that it is impossible for us to say
definitively exactly how it makes its decision. What we do know is that
the model exploits correlations in the training data between input
features (pixels) and outputs (object locations) in potentially
unpredictable ways.

{% include figure.html
        img="figures/yolofooled.png"
        width="40%"
        alt="A stop sign is shown with various stickers on it.  On top of the stickers, erroneous identifications of bottles are shown (no bottles are present in the image)."
        caption="A stop sign with a specially crafted sticker that causes a neural network to fail to identify it as a stop sign." %}
{% assign yolofooled = figure_number %}

The complexity of the model makes it vulnerable to bad actors (or
adversaries). Researchers at University of Michigan used a form of ML
known as *adversarial machine learning* to [create a specially crafted
sticker that could be attached to a stop sign that would make it
invisible to the YOLO
model](https://iotsecurity.engin.umich.edu/physical-adversarial-examples-for-object-detectors/)
(that is YOLO would not identify it as a stop sign). Clearly, this has
major implications for the safety of using a model such as this in an
application like a self-driving car. An example of the attack is shown
in {% include figure_reference.html fig_num=yolofooled %}.

## Idea 2: There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch

> ["All models are wrong, but some
> useful."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)
>
> --- George Box

At the beginning of this document we have a reminder of the basic
supervised machine learning setup. A one sentence statement of the setup
is that we try to generalize from a set of training data to construct a
function $\hat{f}^\star$ that best predicts the corresponding output
data for unseen input data (e.g., predicting the facial expression of a
face that was not in the training set based on a training set of sample
faces). In the previous big idea, we discussed how machine learning
could go wrong when there are correlations in the data that seem useful
to the ML algorithm but are ultimately counterproductive to how we'd
like the system to make decisions. It turns out that even before you
choose the training data for your algorithm, you must provide an
[inductive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias) to
constrain the space of possible models you might fit. Examples of common
inductive biases include the following (the previously linked article
has some more).

The prediction function $\hat{f}^\star$ should change smoothly as you
vary the input $\mathbf{x}$.

The prediction function has a particular form (e.g., linear).

The prediction function is sparse (it ignores the majority of the
inputs).

In fact, there are a whole class of theorems called [No-Free-Lunch (NFL)
theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem) that
state that without inductive biases (such as the ones stated above),
learning from data is essentially impossible. This connects us back to
the quote from George Box. While the inductive bias we encode into our
model will never fully represent reality, having this bias is necessary
to allow the model to do the useful work of making predictions. What's
important for us as machine learning scientists and practitioners is to
be explicit about the biases we are introducing when settling on a
particular model so that we can best evaluate our results and predict
the limitations of our systems.

## Idea 3: It's All About How You Frame the Problem

Using Machine Learning algorithms can be a bit disorienting for someone
used to the typical engineering workflow. A cartoon picture of the
engineering workflow is that you are given a problem (perhaps it is
initially difficult to solve or ambiguous), you might reframe the
problem to make it easier to solve, and then you work to devise a
solution to the reframed problem. In machine learning, the last step is
replaced by providing examples of how you'd like your system to work
(i.e., input / output pairs), and then the creation of the actual system
is automated by the ML algorithm! Your job as an ML practitioner is to
reframe the original problem (both by specifying the form of the model
and giving appropriate training data) so that the ML algorithm can
compute a solution. If you've done the reframing properly, the solution
to the reframed problem will also be a good solution to the original
problem.

As an example of when a solution to the reframed problem would not be
desirable, consider the use of a machine learning algorithm to teach a
virtual character to walk in a simulated environment. You might reframe
this problem for the ML algorithm as tasking it with computing a
controller for the virtual character that moves the character's center
of mass forward as fast as possible. The ML algorithm can now search
over a vast space of possible control strategies to learn the one that
most quickly propels the center of mass. However, it doesn't necessarily
follow that this controller will result in the character walking using a
normal bipedal gait.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="figures/fallingbot.png" width="80%"/>
</div>

The notion that the solution an algorithm finds might be unpredictable
to the designer is known as "emergence." Some cool examples of this
played out in actual experiments in evolving virtual creatures, which
are summarized in the paper [The Surprising Creativity of Digital
Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03453.pdf). For instance, a
virtual character learned that falling down, see picture above, and
getting up was more efficient for locomotion than constantly hopping
(which is what the designer had intended the system to learn).

For more examples of this sort of thing, consider checking out [Karl
Sims: Evolved Virtual
Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBt0imn77Zg) or the short
article [When AI Surprises
Us](https://aiweirdness.com/post/172894792687/when-algorithms-surprise-us).
This also connects back to the age-old debate over whether [falling with
style can be considered
flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwN6efmhp7E).

## Idea 4: ML Systems Can Learn Intermediate Representations

In the next few weeks we'll learn about artificial neural networks
(ANNs). ANNs are biologically inspired algorithms since their
functioning, at an abstract level, is modeled on the functioning of
biological neurons (e.g., in the brain).

{% include figure.html
        img="figures/Colored_neural_network.png"
        alt="a schematic of a neural network is shown.  Circles represent nodes, which are connected to other nodes using arrows"
        caption="An artificial neural network with a single hidden layer." %}
{% assign annfigure = figure_number %}

ANNs accept input patterns at an array of virtual neurons called the
input layer (see {% include figure_reference.html fig_num=annfigure %}). The neurons in the input layer are connected to
other neurons via virtual [axons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon)
that control to what extent a particular input neuron activates a
downstream neuron. The second set of neurons, called the "hidden layer"
(shown in blue in the middle of the figure), is responsible for
computing intermediate, hidden representations of the input data. This
process continues as activations propagate through the network until
activations are generated at the output layer (shown in green on the
right of the figure). These outputs could correspond to any salient
properties of the input (e.g., if the input is an image, the output
might encode the objects in the image).

What's amazing about ANNs is that there are learning algorithms for
setting the connection strengths between these virtual neurons (the
black arrows in {% include figure_reference.html fig_num=annfigure %}) based on training data (input / output pairs).
These learning algorithms tune the connections strengths (also called
"weights") such that for the provided training data the network produces
the appropriate training outputs (e.g., if you show the network a
training set of images of cats or dogs, over time the network will
adjust its weights so that the output is "cat" when the network is
presented an image of a cat and "dog" if presented an image of a dog).
The algorithms used to tune the network weights are only concerned with
reproducing the output patterns, the network is free to choose how it
represents information within the network (i.e., at the hidden layer).

{% include figure.html
        img="figures/learned_receptive_fields.png"
        alt="images are shown representing various receptive fields learned by a neural network.  The images show receptive fields with oriented bars."
        caption="12x12 receptive fields learned from an neural network trained to optimally compress images"
%}
{% assign learnedfields=figure_number %}

What's super amazing is that we can actually examine the internal
representations of a neural network to understand how it's performing
the computation from input to output. For instance, {% include figure_reference.html fig_num=learnedfields %}[^2] shows a visualization of the internal
representations learned by a network trained to best compress a training
set of images (these sorts of networks are called "auto-encoders"). The
receptive fields of each of the hidden units in the network and can be
understood as specifying how each input pixel activates a particular
hidden unit (gray corresponds to no activation, black to negative
activation, and white to positive activation). It's remarkable that
these receptive fields have coherent structure: they are localized in
space, tuned to particular orientations, and tuned to features at a
particular scale. You can think of these as oriented edge detectors that
the network learned completely on its own (it was never told to extract
edges from the images in the training set).

What's super-duper amazing is that if we compare the receptive fields
learned by the artificial neural network to the [simple
cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_cell) in the primary visual
cortex of a cat, there are a number of striking similarities. Just as in
the ANN, the biological neural network responds to edges at particular
orientations and scales. The scientists Hubel and Wiesel performed the
pioneering work in neuroscience to establish the properties of receptive
fields in the primary visual cortex. Consider watching [a video of their
experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VdFf3egwfg) that eventually
garnered a Nobel prize (note that in the video the static sound
corresponds to the measurement of spikes in activity of an individual
neuron in the brain of an anesthetized cat).[^3]. The implication of the
similarity between the receptive fields of the neurons in the cat brain
and the virtual neurons in the ANN is that they are similar because they
are fundamentally solving the same problem (i.e., efficiently
representing visual information). In this light, that they should find
similar solutions to this problem is not as surprising as it may first
seem.

## Idea 5: Machine Learning Zoomed Out

Historically, most ML courses have been laser-focused on learning about
learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines,
decision trees, etc.). In some courses there would be a little bit of
emphasis on machine learning applications, which have always been
strongly tied to the research in ML algorithms and theory. The focus on
ML algorithms also reflected the positioning of these courses within
Computer Science curricula, which approached the field more from a
liberal arts perspective rather than an engineering one.

A number of recent trends have made the almost sole focus on learning
algorithms insufficient for those who want to either use ML in their
careers or go into ML as a field.

The explosion of data has made the skills necessary for collecting,
wrangling, exploring, and cleaning data very relevant.

Improvements in the accuracy of ML algorithms coupled with the ability
to deploy ML systems to a wide variety of devices (e.g., mobile phones)
means that it is increasingly important to consider how ML systems will
behave in real-world, highly complex settings.

The first point ties into a set of skills sometimes grouped under "Data
Science." While we will have a comparatively lesser focus on this
skillset than in our dedicated Data Science course, we will be learning
some of these skills. The second point corresponds to ML systems as
embedded in larger and more complex contexts. As you've seen from some
of the examples earlier in this document, unexpected things can happen
when ML algorithms meet messy and/or biased real world data (take for
example the automated job applicant evaluator). In light of this, again,
we think that the traditional focus on ML algorithms is not adequate for
a modern class on ML. Here are two figures to further illustrate this
point.

![A schematic of a machine learning system including all of the relevant components.](figures/MlSystem.png)

In the figure above, the box labeled *ML Code* is the actual learning
algorithm. But in modern systems, this is but a small fraction of all of
the tools needed to deploy a real world ML system. This is not to say
that we will be spending a lot of time learning about each of these
other boxes (we will learn about some of them), but it helps to have a
sense of the software ecosystem in which your ML model would be
deployed.

![A diagram of the sociotechnical view of machine learning.  The system highlights things like policy, culture, and infrastructure.](figures/sociotechnical.png)

In addition to understanding how ML code is situated within larger
software ecosystems, it is even more important to realize the
[socio-technical
context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system) in which
an ML system is deployed. The figure above shows a socio-technical
analysis of a technology. The figure highlights the need to consider
contextual factors such as user impacts, culture, and regulations when
analyzing technologies.

Using the tools of socio-technical systems analysis is becoming
increasingly popular for analyzing machine learning systems. We'll be
digging into some of these resources later in the course, but here are
two papers in this spirit.

Systems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287598)

## Idea 6: It's Not All Doom and Gloom

While we'll be talking a lot about how ML can go wrong, unleashing
unexpected consequences, we'll also be talking about the positive things
that ML can do. Here are just a couple of resources that discuss such
systems (not to say that these systems don't have the potential for
things to go wrong!). We'll leave this list deliberately short to give
you a chance to find your own example in the exercise below.  Some of these examples are a little old, but they are still good starting points.

examples](https://www.springboard.com/blog/ai-for-good/)
* While not without controversy, some companies (and researchers) are working on [Enhancing Accessibility with AI and ML](https://www.deque.com/blog/enhancing-accessibility-with-ai-and-ml/).
