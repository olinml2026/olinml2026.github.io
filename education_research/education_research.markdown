This semester, we are conducting a research study on student experiences within this course. Through this study, we hope
to better understand how the course affects things such as student motivation, interest and knowledge in human-centered design approaches
for machine learning, and the type of work students see themselves doing going forward.

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and your grade will not depend on
whether or not participate.

If you decide that you want to participate, you can read our [informed consent form](Informed_Consent_Document.pdf).  To enroll in the study, please return (either physically or electronically) a
signed copy of the form to me (Paul Ruvolo).

The data we collect for this study will include:
1. Pre-course and post-course surveys (each will take approximately 20 minutes).  These surveys are required to be done by all students in the course, but only the data from students who are participants will be used for research.
2. Reflection prompts, which will appear as part of some assignments.  Similar to (1), all students will be required to do these reflections, but we will only use responses from students in the study for research.
3. Interview or focus-group with Chelsea Andrews (Research Assistant Professor at Tufts University).  All students who participate in the research study, have the (optional) opportunity to meet with Chelsea Andrews to provide additional details about your experiences in the course.  Meetings will be available for individual conversations with Chelsea and focus-group sessions.  Unlike (1) and (2), if you are not part of the research study, you will not be required to do one of these sessions.
