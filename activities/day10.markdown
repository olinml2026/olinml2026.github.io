# Demystifying Pytorch

We'll be going through [the day 9 notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olinml2024/notebooks/blob/main/ML24_Day09.ipynb).  There are three things we want you to get out of this notebook.

* Pytorch is quite similar in its basic concepts to the micrograd framework you implemented.
* We can use pytorch to compute a line of best fit.  This will allow us to visualize the optimization process more easily.
* We can use pytorch modules (e.g., `nn.Linear`) to make our lives easier.
