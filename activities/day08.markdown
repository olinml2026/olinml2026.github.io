# Gather information based on external sources

On the whiteboard, please gather pieces of information that we learned from the readings or other sources. Take turns having each person share one thing that they wrote down for Exercise 1 in the last assignment.

# Large group debrief and introduction of the impossibility theorem 

Here are some [summary slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I1rMkqJYiOuaYAmzKzj3oshUxqdPa_wiOlqtnt4qbLc/edit?usp=sharing), which also include refernce to the study Sam mentioned with humans attempting to predict re-arrest.

We'll summarize some key takeaways and show an example from an extreme version to help us wrap our heads around different models of fairness.

# Small group exploration and sense-making of fairness metrics 

The field of fairness and applications to human or algorithmic decision making is vast. Here are a few resources to guide your exploration of fairness metrics:
* [IBM's exploration of COMPAS and fairness metrics](https://aif360.res.ibm.com/data)
* [One group that made a tool for fairness and has a flowchart](https://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/aequitas/)
* [Orange and blue dot example of fairness from the last assignment](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/)
* [Fair prediction with disparate impact - math paper on COMPAS](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/files/disparate_impact.pdf)

# Large group discussion of the big picture

We will close our computers for this part and have a large group guided discussion.
