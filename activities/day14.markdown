# Reflection on assessment and course
If you already filled out the 2019 version of the survey, please still fill this one out, but it's fine to skip over the general course comments if you've already shared what you want to share in the other survey.  Again, sorry for the wrong link last time!

# GPT party

We'll start on the homework together by watching one of the 3B1B videos and pausing to talk through each of the steps.
