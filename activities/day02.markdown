# Debrief on the last assignment

1. Introduce yourselves
2. Quickly draw a confusion matrix at your table and write the equations for accuracy, precision, and recall.
3. Discuss your answers for Exercise 9 in the Colab notebook (see exercise below as a reminder).

    Exercise 9: Summarize how well the dessert classifier works for french toast and red velvet cake.
    Come to class prepared to share this at your table.
    Consider the confusion matrix, precision, and recall. How do you interpret this?
    What does it mean for life as french toast or as red velvet cake?

# Community-Centered Design for ML

* Slide deck from summer + something more active to cap it off (e.g., critiquing something we did or extending it in some way)
